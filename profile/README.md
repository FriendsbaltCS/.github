# Friends CS

Welcome to the Friends School of Baltimore Department of Computer Science!

In this organization, you will find all of the course repositories and supporting
code for courses taught by the department. As a general rule (unless otherwise noted)
all materials are released under the MIT license. In short, you are generally free to use and modify
anything (even sell it if you find someone to pay you).

## Development

This organization is new and under ongoing (read "perpetual") development. Materials will be posted
and updated in service of the goal of total curricular transparency. We hope that you will find them
useful.

Currently, we have the following courses available (beta):

- [Web and the User Experience](https://github.com/FSBCS/WebUX)
- [Advanced Topics in CS: The Internet (partially)](https://github.com/FSBCS/ACS)

Coming soon:

- Physical Computing (using raspberrypi pico with circuitPython)
